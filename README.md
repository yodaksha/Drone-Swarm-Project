The purpose of this program is to simulate multiple drones moving in a 2D environment (like a grid or map).
Each drone can:
Move around to explore regions.
Avoid collisions.
Communicate or share information.
Visualize their movement and exploration path.
The simulation uses Tkinter GUI + Pillow (PIL) to show real-time movement.
